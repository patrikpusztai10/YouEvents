There are many apps available on the market which people can use to find events. But some of them are only posted on Instagram, or only on Facebook, or Tiktok. YouEvents centralizes these events, allowing for
an easier management.
Event organizers can upload events and people who are interested in going can "like" those events to save them, making this process much easier.
